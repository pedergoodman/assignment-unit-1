    If there are files in the folder the output would be a list of the folders and files. Files would have their 
    extension shown. 
    If there are no files in the folder, then terminal returns nothing.

    $ touch <file_name>

    git version 2.39.1

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

    You would run this command to check the status of your files. It'll show you how far ahead your branch is 
    from 'origin/main', changes staged for commit, and changes not staged for commit. 

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

    Adds all not staged files to staging area.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?

    $ git push origin main 
    also, if main is the current branch, then '$ git push' works too.
